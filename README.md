Repository for CMPT 432, Design of Compilers, with Professor Labouseur.

I will be using the programming language Java this semester for the compiler project and for the labs.
I am currently running Java version 1.8.0_201 and using the Java SE Development Kit 8 found on Oracle's website, which includes the version 1.8.0_121 Java compiler.

I am programming all assignments on a 64 bit Windows 10 machine using the Eclipse IDE. Besides the Java Runtime Environment and Java compiler, no other programs will be neccessary to run the projects and labs uploaded to this repository.
There will be frequent commits to this repository throughout the semester for each assignment.

I have included a "Hello World" program as a test to make sure there are no errors in compilation of submitted assignments to GitHub.
If you have any questions about my development process or you are encountering any difficulties, please let me know.

Alex Smith
